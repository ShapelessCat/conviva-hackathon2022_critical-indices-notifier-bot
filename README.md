# Critical Indices Notifier Bot

## Setup

When developing this project, we use Python 3.9.15, and the required packages a listed in the
_requirements.txt_ file.

## Usage

The usage is simple. Just run the _bot.py_, and it will send a report to a Slack channel that is
connected to a Slack bot we created. Currently, some info in this project are hard coded. In
reality, when we have time to finish all the customizable parts, we should make them configurable.
Now this project is a POC, and it mainly for show and tell.
